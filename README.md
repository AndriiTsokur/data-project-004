# Indicators of Heavy Traffic on I-94

In this project, we're going to analyze a dataset about the westbound traffic on the [I-94 Interstate highway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_94).

The goal of the analysis is to determine a few indicators of heavy traffic on I-94. These indicators can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc.

**The tools used are:**

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

The step-by-step milestones and final result are shown [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/AndriiTsokur/data-project-004/blob/main/finding_heavy_traffic_indicators_on_i94.ipynb)
